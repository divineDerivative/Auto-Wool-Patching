	<description>Another continuation of Better Wool Production, but using C# to automagically make fleece for all wools. No more waiting for someone to add a patch for new mods, it just works!

   • Shearable animals now yield unfinished fleece instead of wool, which needs to be processed into usable wool at a crafting spot or tailoring bench.
   • Butchering shearable animals now gives a reduced amount of fleece, about half what you would get from a normal shearing.
   • New recipe for blended wool, which can be made with random bits of wool, similar to patchleather</description>
